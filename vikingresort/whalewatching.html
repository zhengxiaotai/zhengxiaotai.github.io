                        <p>
                            Whales are large aquatic mammals, also known as cetaceans. Several 
                            civilizations, including Icelanders, are known to have hunted them 
                            since as early as 875 AD.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today whaling is a less significant industry, and the ocean’s gentle 
                            giants are seen more as a tourist attraction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In here, you can catch whales splashing around under the Northern 
                            Lights or illuminated by the midnight sun, depending on what time of 
                            year you visit. Tours depart from Reykjavik and various other 
                            locations around Iceland all year round.
                        </p>

                            <h3 class="paragraph-title">Minke Whales</h3>
                            <p>
                                Minke whales are the most common great whale in Iceland’s waters, 
                                with many migrating here throughout summer and a few lingering 
                                through the winter months.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They are small compared to other species but can still exceed nine 
                                meters in length. Their behavior is usually rather shy, but due to 
                                their numbers, you can regularly see them from almost all 
                                whale-watching ports.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Humpback whales also come to Iceland during the summer months.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike minke whales, humpbacks are renowned for their gregarious 
                                and acrobatic behavior. Humpback whales are basically the 
                                attention-seeking divas of the whale world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is common to see them on whale-watching tours, breaching, 
                                slapping their tails and flukes, or feeding.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                White-beaked dolphins are the most commonly seen dolphin around 
                                Iceland, staying close to the shore throughout the year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They live in pods ranging from a few individuals to a hundred, 
                                and, though a bulky species, you can often see them bow-riding, 
                                breaching, and playing at the surface.
