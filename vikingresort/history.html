                        Vikings were the seafaring Norse people from southern Scandinavia 
                        (present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden) who from the late 8th to late 11th 
                        centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of Europe. 
                        They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle 
                        East, and North America. They raided and settled, the period is known as 
                        the Viking Age. The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval 
                        history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus.

                        Expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic longships, 
                        Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, 
                        Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, the Baltic coast, 
                        and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in what is now European 
                        Russia, Belarus and Ukraine (where they were also known as Varangians). The 
                        Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people, Faroese and Icelanders emerged from 
                        these Norse colonies. The Vikings also voyaged to Constantinople, Iran and 
                        Arabia. They were the first Europeans to reach North America, briefly 
                        settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to 
                        foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines and 
                        foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, profoundly influencing the 
                        genetic and historical development of both. During the Viking Age the Norse 
                        homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three 
                        larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

                        The Vikings spoke Old Norse and made inscriptions in runes. For most of the 
                        period they followed the Old Norse religion, but later became Christians. 
                        The Vikings had their own laws, art and architecture. Most Vikings were 
                        also farmers, fishermen, craftsmen and traders. Current popular 
                        representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and 
                        stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy.

                        In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a important series of events, including a

                        (Odin, Thor, Týr, etc.), natural disasters and the submersion of the world

                        The Nibelung is a personal or clan name with several competing and 
                        contradictory uses in Germanic heroic legend. It is often connected to the 
                        root nebel, meaning mist.

                        In medieval German, several other uses of the term Nibelung are documented 
                        besides the reference to the Gibichungs: it refers to the king and 
                        inhabitants of a mythical land inhabited by dwarfs and giants in the first 
                        half of the Nibelungenlied, as well as to the father and one of two 
                        brothers fighting over a divided inheritance. This land and its inhabitants 
                        give their name to the "hoard of the Nibelungs" (Middle High German der 
                        Nibelunge hort). In the late medieval Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid, the name, in 
                        the form Nybling or Nibling, is given to a dwarf who again gives his name 
                        to the treasure.

                        In the eddic poem Atlakviða, the word Niflungar is applied three times to 
                        the treasure or hoard of Gunnar (the Norse counterpart of German Gunther). 
                        It is also applied once to Gunnar's warriors and once to Gunnar himself. 
                        It elsewhere appears unambiguously as the name of the lineage to which the 
                        brothers Gunnar and Högni belong and seems mostly interchangeable with 
                        Gjúkingar or Gjúkungar, meaning descendants of Gjúki, Gjúki being Gunnar's 
                        father.
