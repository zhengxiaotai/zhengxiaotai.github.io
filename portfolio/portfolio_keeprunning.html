                    An AR glasses for people who regularly running for exercise. As a kind of 
                    aerobic, running could be monoronous and boring. However, running could be 
                    more fun if combining with music and visual effects. Strictly speed-classified 
                    music can help users to keep a even pace and breath, and collective items in 
                    the AR glasses can also attract them to explore the random track and persist to 
                    complete the running. The KeepRunning AR glasses can provide a interesting and 
                    unique running experience no matter you are running on the street, sportground, 
                    or even on the running machine. Also with the use of supporting mobile app, 
                    users can cuztomize their running plans, speeds, song lists, and more.

                    As a popular way of exercise, running is still adopted by lots of people even 
                    more ways of exercise have emerged with the development of fitness. However, 
                    this most obvious disadvantage is its monotonous and boring process, which is 
                    also the main reason that people failed to keep running.

                <p class="content">
                    To help people get more motivation and keep running, we designed "KeepRunning", 
                    a running-scenario AR glasses which has more entertainment performance. with 
                    the advanced technology of augment reality, the running process can be gamified 
                    without affect the real life environment where users are running at. And as a 
                    wearable, running scenario is also considered to make the glasses lightweight, 
                    firm, and stable.

                    As music and rhythm has becoming a trend in the fitness field, "KeepRunning" 
                    combine music and running to provide an interesting experience. Music with same 
                    BPM are selected and allows users to cuztomize, this could help users to keep a 
                    constance pace and pattern of breath. Also visualizing the rhythm in the glasses 
                    without blocking the sight can also guide users' pace and provie a novel and 
                    interesting running experience. As people's pace and speed are different, the 
                    BPM and song lists can be customized in the supportive app to fit the 
                    prefereneces for each user. Other settings such as running time, modes, routes 
                    can be customized as well to have better experience.

                    Besides, in order to encourage users finish the whole runing route without 
                    taking any shortcuts, collectable coins are placed on the route and displayed 
                    in the glasses. These coins can be used to redeem extra songs and unlock more 
                    song lists on the supportive app. Users can set the running plan on the mobile 
                    app in advance and select the running mode (street, sportground, or running 
                    machine), system will generate the route and select a song list automatically 
                    then users can start their running.

                    During the design process, Unity and Arduino are used for prototype building 
                    to simulate the running scenario with physical interactions in virtual 
                    environment. The prototype focused on several hypothesis for the project, such 
                    as "users are less likely to take shortcuts if there are collectable items on 
                    the route", "users are willing to follow the rhythm if there are music". 
                    Multiple tests of the prototype are held with potential users, hypothesis have 
                    been justified, and valuable feedbacks have been gathered for further 
                    improvements.
