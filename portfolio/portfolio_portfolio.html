                    The style of portfolio reflects author's personality, in order to present an 
                    interesting and happy me, I decided to make it a hand-drawn style. Consider the 
                    formative and the impression of my work for the audience, hand-drawn elements 
                    are only designed as decorations and supportive things, and the main content 
                    are more formal and consist with the theme of the project. So I drew some 
                    decorations and illustration images on my iPad using a chalk-like brush 
                    although I'm not good at it (seems that the clouds are the most successful 
                    ones). 
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    The main color theme are designed as dark blue, because it can provides a sense 
                    of steady, rational, and technology. It also has a feeling of high-ended as I 
                    utilized the font <span class="font-futura">Futura</span>, which is commonly 
                    used in the design related with fashion and future. Another font 
                    <span class="font-littlepat">LittlePat</span> was used on the navigation bar to 
                    fit the hand-drawn elements, and because it is more regular as a handwritten 
                    font, it could perfectly fit the theme of this portfolio as some supplementary 
                    elements. Unfortunately this font is not a complete version and it lacks 
                    numbers and most of the symbol characters.

                <p class="content">
                    As the "Survive" project is the main part of this portfolio, the page will have 
                    a large amount of content and it is important to present the design process and 
                    reflections. With the thought of visualizing the process and referencing one of 
                    the paper that I reviewed, I decided to use parallax scrolling to present 
                    animations and visual effects that could illustrate the narrative process in a 
                    better way. The position transfer in scrolling are used in inspiration bubbles 
                    and data accessing to present a bubbling effect and the flow of data. While the 
                    main design style changes used fixed background to present a effect that is 
                    commonly used in some trailer videos and fashion websites. So as the audience 
                    scroll down the webpage, they could have an intuitive and interesting view of 
                    of the design process. And the dynamic box shadow can provide a sense of 
                    stereoscopic of portpolio gallery. Besides, this has also been used at the 
                    clouds on the homepage to make them "floating in the sky".
