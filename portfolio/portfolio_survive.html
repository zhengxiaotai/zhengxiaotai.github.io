                <p class="content">
                    When starting to live and study in an unfamiliar city, safety is always an 
                    important issue. As an international student in UQ, this sparked our idea of 
                    the educational website about teaching students how to deal with emergencies 
                    and offences and protect themselves, and we designed and implemented it as a 
                    group.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    Based on a few interviews of our classmates in UQ we have made, the original 
                    idea of the website is to make it a story-based game, so users can learn safety 
                    knowledge more engagingly. With the offences rate dataset to keep students to 
                    stay alert, and the nearby services location & contact (police stations, 
                    hospitals, ambulance stations, etc.) are extracted from datasets respectively 
                    to allow users get familiar with their living surroundings. Besides, I searched 
                    for relative information and similar websites that might be helpful and came up 
                    with potential game ideas that could suit the target user, then discussed with 
                    group members to build the design.

                <p class="content">
                    We spent more time designing the game as it is the most important feature of 
                    the website. Considering the target users as new university students, the game 
                    should be interactive, and the content should be intuitive and contains 
                    sufficient safety knowledge. So we originally designed the game as a linear 
                    text-based story game with real situations and location, and the story is 
                    pushed forward by different choices for users in each plot. And a real map is 
                    embedded in the game for users to recognize the important services nearby and 
                    make the best choice according to the character's location as well.
                </p>
                <!-- interactions -->
                <p class="content">
                    I thought about different interactions in the game regardless of the 
                    implementation, such as a graphical scene could be intuitive and have a better 
                    experience, but still hard to combine with location information and cost more 
                    time to create the scene images. While a map-based game could present a 
                    holistic and immersion scene and is more interactive than text with each 
                    elements and interactions on the map. This was originally adopted after our 
                    discussion.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    In the meantime, we started to think about the game story, which contains 
                    specific offence types chosen from the offences rate dataset. To present 
                    positive and helpful guidance for students, we referred to some official 
                    websites about Australian law and consulted a friend of ours majoring in law. 
                    In this case, the reliability of the game story and options could be ensured.

                <h1 class="title">Prototyping</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    As we started to build the low fidelity prototype, the colour theme was decided 
                    as light blue with low contrast and simple shapes and text as contents. With 
                    the prototype, we found 3 participants and 1 tutor for a testing session. 
                    According to the feedbacks, several participants mentioned that some important 
                    features are inconspicuous and sometimes they didn't notice them, even for the 
                    choices. I considered this problem could be solved from both the colour theme 
                    and the choice presenting. For the colour theme, we decided to use some bright 
                    colours. With an idea of retro style and a feeling of old notebook and 
                    detective, we tried the colour theme of orange-yellow-brown in the next 
                    iteration. Still, it looks weird especially with the real map embedded, and it 
                    doesn't feel serious enough as we named it "Survive". Finally, we decide to 
                    make it black-white-grey themed, because the topic of safety is about life and 
                    death, the high contrast of black and white can present a sense of solemnness 
                    and warn users to take it seriously. With key elements such as current choices 
                    and services link set to light orange, it could guide users with the whole 
                    process and the colour itself provides a sense of safety and hope. For the 
                    choices, it does hard to notice as there are lots of colours and icons on the 
                    map. We tried the text choices in the next iteration, but the horizontal style 
                    looks like users are taking an exam, especially for students. So we decided to 
                    make it more like sticky notes, and a pin icon for selected choice.
                </p>
                <!-- layout -->
                <p class="content">
                    As we started to refine the layout, it is hard for us to balance the scene 
                    image and the map on the same page. Users should see the most important feature 
                    when they first enter the page, which is the scene image because it is 
                    intuitive. Then the layout should be easy to follow and guide users through the 
                    scene, that is reading the description and checking the options and map. With 
                    this in mind, we adopted a left/right layout with the scene image taking the 
                    largest place. Descriptions and choices are on the right for users to read 
                    through, and the map takes place at a corner. Although we have considered an 
                    up/down layout with icons leading users' sight, but its asymmetric makes it 
                    lack aesthetics, so this proposal was abandoned.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    As we came to the game map page, which is the entrance of different games, 
                    users choose different cities to see its detailed offences data and start the 
                    game. Originally it was designed as a real map of QLD with icons representing 
                    cities as the game entrance. But considering previous feedback about our 
                    prototype that there are too many elements on this page, this might lead to 
                    information overload. And also the colour theme of the map is not compatible. 
                    In consideration of simplifying this page and with inspirations from another 
                    hand-drawn style website, the map was replaced by a concise and abstract one 
                    with outlines and several main roads of QLD visible only. In this case, 
                    information can be easily recognized and pins of the city are more conspicuous. 
                    The offence rate data and the game entrance could be on a popup window at the 
                    right, which is the ocean part of the map.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    The service map was designed as a common searching page, with the map as the 
                    main element, and the searching bar and result list on the left. As not all of 
                    the GIS dataset contains text-based addresses and telephone, we decided to fill 
                    in the general emergency number 000 for the empty ones for consistency.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    With a refined prototype with a whole game process simulated, another testing 
                    session was made and focused more on the game flow and interactions. According 
                    to the feedback, the most important issue is it lack of features to let users 
                    know whether their choice is good or bad. Even with descriptions at the end, 
                    users might forget previous scenes. So we decided to present a text-based 
                    consequence after each plot and provide tips for the scene to guide them on 
                    what to do when facing this situation. Besides, considering one of the 
                    participants' advice, which is adding visualized or quantified results for the 
                    game, we decided to add scores for each choice, and a 3-star icon to illustrate 
                    the score of each scene. A percentage score and summary will be on the ending 
                    page. In this case, users will learn about the options and rationality in time 
                    as long as they made the choice.

                    For implementation of the website, MySQL database is used for the storage of 
                    game plots and sequences. The story, scene, choices, and other additional 
                    information were designed in seperated tables and loaded after each choice was 
                    made. The map was implemented utilizing Leaflet.js to present the geographical 
                    information and the location of the services were extracted from datasets by 
                    POST request using AJAX. Besides, simple animations created by CSS were added 
                    in the game feature such as fade in/out and slide in/out, that is to present a 
                    coherent experience while going through these game plots.

                    For the project, although the final product still have some problems and 
                    potential improvements to be made, generally the current website can meet the 
                    need of safety education we have proposed at the beginning and have made a 
                    functional website that provides with essensial safety knowledge for students. 
                    We believe that the whole process and outcomes are successful, We also realized

                    visual effects</span>. However, regardless some limitations of this course and 
                    technical issues, the website could have more features. Such as adjusting map 
                    location according to users' location so university students from all over the 
                    world can use it. And the game could be more interesting if the story is 
                    designed as branched instead of linear, so users can have completely different 
                    storylines made by themselves.
