                    With the rapid development of technology, note taking for students has been 
                    turning into digital form, and tablet PC such as iPad has become a commonly 
                    used device for them. Although lots of note taking applications have emerged, 
                    None of them can fully satisfy students' needs for their study according to our 
                    research. Issues includes the efficiency and layout arrangement especially in 
                    handwritten notes, and also the combination of notes and course resources and 
                    documents.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    In consideration of the painpoint above, we designed the Awesome Note - a 
                    handwritten note taking application on tablet mainly for students. We have 
                    simplified most of the interactions when creating and making notes, so that 
                    users can spend less time and won't missing any content in their lecture. 
                    Functions includes one click to create notes rather than defining directory and 
                    name in advance, press and hold the pen to use eraser rather than switching 
                    between pen and eraser, and it can also adjust the layout automatically and 
                    generate headings and anchors according to the content.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    As for PDF documents, users can either insert a specific page to a existing 
                    note, or open the file as a seperate note. In the PDF file mode, in addition to 
                    the basic functions that a PDF reader has, Awesome Note also suport internal 
                    spliting screen function in consideration of the revision scenario for students. 
                    In this case, PDF file and note are associated and saved as a whole, users can 
                    making note while viewing the document and don't need to switch between apps. 
                    Besides, notes that have made in this mode can also be automatically adjusted, 
                    creating anchors and linked to specific locations in the document where users 
                    was viewing while making this piece of note, so users can jump to specific 
                    sections quickly and have a corresponding view of the content and their note 
                    while they review.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    Also, in order to simplify operations of summarizing and organizing notes, 
                    Awesome Note have abandoned the complex tree structure of note organization. 
                    By allowing users to add tags to each note with "#", they can search and find 
                    their notes by tags and modify dates on the homepage.
