                    SmartQ is a online digital questionnaire system designed for clinicians and 
                    medical students according to Australian healthcare system. By presenting PROMs 
                    questionnaires to users, SmartQ provides patient-centered healthcare services, 
                    and continuous evaluation and treatment, thus to supersede traditional paper 
                    questionnaires and improve efficiency of practitioners. Currently, it also 
                    provides an practical opportunity for UQ medical students to learn about the 
                    medical system in Australia.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    In SmartQ, patient can complete questionnaires either by themselves or with the 
                    assistance of practitioners, after which they can get detailed feedback and 
                    explanations. Practitioners have access to previous questionnaires and results 
                    that specific patient has done in the past in order to evaluate patients' 
                    health status. Besides, SmartQ utilizes FHIR 4.0 standard which adapting to 
                    mainstream healthcare systems in Australia.

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    In traditional healthcare systems, questionnaires are usually printed on paper
                    and handed to patients to complete. This process have lots of issues such as 
                    low efficiency and difficult to preserve and retrieve. As the development of 
                    technology, healthcare systems in Australia has also benefit from it and have 
                    great improvement, the emerge and widely use of FHIR standard is the strongest 
                    evidence. However, research indicated that there are still quite a few medical 
                    institutions that have not fully digitalized, or not connected to FHIR standard, 
                    some even still using traditional paper questionnaires. Consequensly, a unified 
                    questionnaire system will help to improve medical staffs' efficiency and 
                    achieve interoperability of different healthcare systems.

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    According to the basic demand and relative literature review, we found a CSIRO 
                    officer and several UQ medical students as participants of our user research 
                    and made interviews with them about Australia healthcare systems and 
                    questionnaire process. As the potential users and future practitioners, our 
                    questions for medical students emphasized on Australia medical system, 
                    consultation process, and current situation of medical questionnaires. While 
                    CSIRO is an Australia research institution, they are more familiar with the 
                    FHIR standard and technical issues, so in addition to the healthcare system 
                    and how FHIR embedded into it, we focused more on the implementation of 
                    questionnaire under FHIR standard and how to integrate with actual consultation 
                    process.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    According to the interview, we figured out that the questionnaire process is 
                    either done by patients themselves or patients with the assistance of the 
                    practitioner, and this happens before the consultation part. As some clinics 
                    have digital questionnaire systems, but they are not integrated into FHIR 
                    standarded system and hard to organize and retrieve, thereby reducing their 
                    efficiency.

                    According to the research outcomes, we have concluded the requirement of the 
                    questionnaire system and targeted existing issues. which is <b>an mobile 
                    digital questionnaire application designed for healthcare systems that allows 
                    patients to complete PROM questionnaires and check results, while provides 
                    clinicians with patient questionnaire results and analysis</b>. The biggest 
                    painpoint is the efficiency of practitioners, so the system should be 
                    simplified to the maximum extent possible both for patients and practitioners. 
                    With all the works have been done so far, we named our system <b>SmartQ</b>
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    Besides, we also learned that our SmartQ system might need SSO to login because 
                    it could be easier for practitioners that using different medical systems, and 
                    it could also allows UQ medical students to login with UQ Portal and get 
                    familiar with the process. Also, some participants wish to have a simplified 
                    login method such as using QR Code.

                <h1>Ideate & Prototype</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    With the summarized requirements and funtions, we organized and determined the 
                    system process. The most critical things is that the end user is uncertained, 
                    as it could be patients themselves, patients with practitioners to complete the 
                    questionnaire, or practitioners to check the results. This could lead to 2 
                    issues, which is the data permission and terminology. According to further 
                    investigation, practitioners will be the main user that operate the SmartQ, 
                    and the questionnaire could be completed by either oral communication with 
                    patients or directly hand over the mobile device to patients. With this 
                    consideration, presented contents in SmartQ are limited to information that is 
                    useful for both patients and practitioners. In this case, patients will not be 
                    confused when completing questionnaires, while practitioners have other means 
                    to access other uncommonly used data as SmartQ is connected to local FHIR 
                    server. As for the terminology, the main part of the questionnaire will be more 
                    descriptive and easy to understand, thus make it easier for patients to answer. 
                    While questionnaire names and explanations will be presented in both layman's 
                    terms and specialist terms as far as possible, so that they can be quickly 
                    understood by both patients and practitioners.

                <p class="content">
                    Low fidelity prototype was designed according to functions and process flow. 
                    There are 2 main modules in SmartQ: do a questionnaire and view questionnaire 
                    results. In the questionnaire part, we decidced to used the simple way to 
                    present questions and choices on the same page, this would provide an 
                    experience that similar to paper questionnaire, and for users they can also 
                    easily look back to check previously answered questions and make adjustment. 
                    For questionnaire results, there will be a total score for each questionnaire 
                    according to their scoring rules, and detailed explanation will also be 
                    provided. In SmartQ, there will be a list to present a specific user's result 
                    in a reverse chronological order, and total scores will also appear on the list 
                    so that practitioners can make a visual comparision across the time. And in the 
                    detailed result page, there will be total score, explanation of the score, and 
                    other detailed information of the whole result. In order to allow patients to 
                    have more idea about the meaning of the score,  an interactable question mark 
                    icon was placed on the top of the score, and a popup layer will be triggered to 
                    present different scoring ranges and its corresponding meanings. The "My 
                    Answers" popup can reappear patient's choices to help practitioners making 
                    diagnosis. As SmartQ needs to display current patient and practitioner's 
                    information, in which only name, age and gender is required, and that is not 
                    sufficient to constitude a seperate user information page. So simplified 
                    information of current patient and practitioner was designed in a section on 
                    the top of every page, just like a navigation bar.

                <p class="content">
                    As green and blue are the most commonly used color for the domain of health and 
                    medical, we tried both two colors in the prototype iteration, and the blue 
                    color theme was finally adopted because it makes people feels more safer. Also, 
                    most Australian medical and healthcare system are using blue color scheme, in 
                    consistent with them would be helpful to adapting and connecting to other 
                    healthcare systems in the future. For the style, we have used the more lively 
                    "Poppins" font and uniformly styled rounded-corner icons. With the simplified 
                    layout together, it could present a concise and comfortable using experience 
                    for both practitioners and patients, and also patients will not be stressed 
                    when doing questionnaires and affect the result.

                <p class="content">
                    In high-fidelity prototype, we have improved the "nav bar" part on the top. We 
                    swapped the location of page navigation and information section, and utilized 
                    rounded-corner and background color to seperate the main part and information 
                    section naturally. Now the main part of the page looks more like a card 
                    floating above the background. And as the page jumpings will be happened within 
                    the card, and will not affect the information section. In this case, the whlole 
                    page will looks more reasonable and aesthetic.

                <h1>Testing</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    3 rounds of testing session were held during prototype iteration. participants  
                    are mainly teaching staffs and students of UQ medical school, and a CSIRO 
                    engineer has attended as well. We mainly used think aloud as our testing method, 
                    observing while they are using the prototype and talk with them to learn about 
                    their thought of our functionality, and following with questions based on their 
                    details that we care about. As the CSIRO engineer is professional in the 
                    technical part of healthcare system, we invited him to run a co-design activity 
                    to help to improve our prototype in a logical aspect.

                    After 3 rounds of testing, we have improved issues that might affect user

                    page elements, and more.

                <h1>Implementation</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    With the consideration of development timeline and the specific login 
                    requirement as a whole, we decided to implement SmartQ as a webpage system 
                    that adapted to mobile devices. In this case, SmartQ can be embedded into 
                    existing apps, then adapt and connected to other existing healthcare systems, 
                    so different users can login easily. As SmartQ is connected to the FHIR server, 
                    it can communicate with the FHIR server directly, access questionnaire 
                    resources and save questionnaire results, and don't need a back-end at all. 
                    All the data such as questionnares, choices, and results are designed according 
                    to the standard of FHIR and save in the form of JSON, all data communication 
                    with the FHIR server is based on those JSON files. Currently there are 5 kinds 
                    of questionnaires in the system and stored locally in the deployment directory. 
                    In the future, a management system can be developed and transfer those data 
                    into database if there is a need of questionnaire data maintenance.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    For the system framework, we utlized Vue.js to implement SmartQ because it can 
                    achieve single-page application, especially for our SmartQ, which needs 
                    partially page jumping, this could provide a smooth questionnaire experience. 
                    Besides, as a componentised framework, Vue.js can achieve high code reusability 
                    and that could simplify development and save time. With third-party libraries 
                    such as FHIR Js Client Library, functions could be easily achieved. According 
                    to the design, we sorted out the data flow diagram, and implement the system 
                    as planned. Finally, the mobile questionnare system SmartQ was completed and 
                    deployed in time.
