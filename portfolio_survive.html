                <p class="content">
                    When starting to live and study in a unfamiliar city, safety is always an 
                    important issue. As an international student in UQ, this sparked our idea of 
                    the educational website about teaching students how to deal with emergencies 
                    and offences and protect themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    The original idea of the website is to make it a story-based game, in this way, 
                    users can learn safety knowledges in a more engaging way. With the offences 
                    rate dataset to keep students to stay alert. And the location & contact of 
                    nearby police stations, hospitals, and ambulance stations are extracted from 
                    datasets respectively and allow users to get familiar with their living 
                    surroundings. In this stage, I <span class="highlight">searched for relative 
                    informations and dataset that might be useful</span>, <span class="highlight">
                    came up with potential ideas of constructing the website</span>, and 
                    <span class="highlight">discussed how could the game suitable for target 
                    users</span>.

                <h1 class="title">Design</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    In the proposal process, We spent large amount of time designing the game as 
                    it is the most important feature of the website. As the target users are new 
                    university students, the game should be interactive, and the content should be 
                    intuitive and contains sufficient safety knowledge. With this consideration, 
                    we designed the game as a linear text-based story game with real situation and 
                    location, and the story is pushed forward by different choices for users in 
                    each plot. Because we realized that same situation happens in different place 
                    could have diverse options to handle, such as considering the distance to the 
                    police station or hospital to decide how to seek help when facing an offence. 
                    This aspect was designed as a real map for users to view current location and 
                    nearby services.
                </p>
                <!-- interactions -->
                <p class="content">
                    We discussed different interactions in the game, such as the whole game and 
                    choices based on the map, or text-based descriptions, etc. Because interactions 
                    on the map could be inconspicuous and can be confused, we decides to make plots 
                    with text descriptions, image illustration, and map supports. Users make 
                    choices by clicking the text, and different options could have diverse 
                    consequences and visualizing evaluations according to some authorized articles 
                    and related laws. 
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    As a decisive part of the process, I <span class="highlight">looked for various 
                    game-related or narrative website for inspiration and reference</span>, 
                    <span class="highlight">designed some main interactions supported by sketches
                    </span>, and <span class="highlight">proposed some additional features in the 
                    website</span>. Although not all of them are adopted in the final product, but 
                    it helped us to make the best option for our design.

                <h1 class="title">Prototyping</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    The original <span class="highlight">color theme</span> in our prototype was 
                    light blue with low contrast. But according to some of the user feedbacks, 
                    some important features are inconspicuous and sometimes they didn't notice 
                    them. In this case, we decided to use some bright colors. With an idea of retro 
                    style and a feeling of old notebook and detective, we tried the color theme of 
                    orange-yellow-brown. Still, it looks wierd especially with the real map 
                    embedded, and it doesn't feels serious enough as we named it "Survive". 
                    Finally, we decide to make it black-white-grey themed, because the topic of 
                    safety is about life and death, the high contrast of black and white can 
                    present a sense of solemn and warn users to take it seriously. With key 
                    elements such as current choices and services link set to light orange, it 
                    could guide users with the whole process and provide a sense of safety and hope 
                    just like the meaning of orange.
                </p>
                <!-- layout -->
                <p class="content">
                    As for the <span class="highlight">layout</span>, it is hard for us to balance 
                    the scene image and the map in the same page. When users enter the page, the 
                    first thing they see should be the most important feature, which is the scene 
                    image because it is intuitive. Then the layout should be easy to follow, that 
                    is read about the scene and look at the options and the map. With this in mind, 
                    we adopted a left/right layout with the scene image takes the largest place. 
                    Descriptions and choices are on the right for users to read through, and the 
                    map takes place at a corner for users to refer. Although we have considered 
                    about a up/down layout which could be easier to follow, but it asymmetric 
                    looking makes it lacks aethetics, so this propose was abandoned.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    The <span class="highlight">game map page</span> is the entrance of different 
                    games, users choose different city and they can see its detailed offences 
                    data and start the game. Originally it was designed as a real map of QLD with 
                    icons represent cities as the game entrance. But some user feedback about our 
                    prototype mentioned that there are too many elements on this page, this might 
                    lead to information overload. And also the color theme is not compatible as 
                    customization is not supported for Leaflet.js. In consideration of simplify 
                    this page and with inspirations from other narrative websites, the map was 
                    replaced by a concise and abstract one with outline and several main road of 
                    QLD visible only. In this case, information can be easily recognised and pins 
                    of the city are more conspicuous.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    We made most of our changes of the design in the prototype & testing process. 
                    As I <span class="highlight">mainly made the website prototype with resources 
                    created by team members</span>, <span class="highlight">generated several 
                    potential layout and colors in the prototype for team deciding</span>, and 
                    <span class="highlight">produced the simplified game entrance map from external 
                    sources</span>, it reflected the importance of discussing with team members 
                    because sometimes they can realize something that I can't, and come up with 
                    better ideas.

                <p class="content">
                    To build the website, a MySQL database is used for the storage of game plots 
                    and their sequences. 3 tables were designed for whole story, scene, and choice 
                    data respectively, and these data was loaded after each choice made in each 
                    scene according to a specific sequence in it. Additional informations such as 
                    scene images, choice consequences, different avatars, etc. is also stored in 
                    extra fields in these table to present a various experience in different game 
                    story.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    Besides, <span class="highlight">dataset</span> were used both within and 
                    outside the game feature. At the description of the game entrance, data of LGA 
                    offences rate are presented to users with a compirason to other cities to 
                    provide a background information and also inform users to be cautious. Services 
                    location data including police stations, hospital, fire stations, and ambulance 
                    stations are presented on the in-game map as reference marks. While "Services" 
                    page is where users can specifically view and search any kind of nearby 
                    services mentioned above, and the map with locations of these services is the 
                    main element on this page, and additional text informations such as address and 
                    telephone are extracted from dataset and present on the list as well to provide 
                    users with details. For those who don't have phone numbers in dataset, a 
                    general number of 000 was displayed instead.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    For the implementation process, I <span class="highlight">led the construction 
                    of the website</span>, <span class="highlight">designed and set up the MySQL

                    For the project, we have made a functional website that provides with 
                    essensial safety knowledge for students. The user test session and feedbacks 
                    from the teaching team have provided us ideas of what users would care and what 
                    we need to concern as a designer. Although there are still some problems to be 
                    solved and some potential improvement could be made according to what we have 
                    learned from the final tradeshow, in general, we believe that the whole process 
                    and outcomes are successful, and also recognized that a good functionality is 
                    important than some cool visual effects. However, regardless some limitations 
                    of this course and technical issues, the website could have more features. Such 
                    as adjusting map location according to users' location so university students 
                    from all over the world can use it. And the game could be more interesting if 
                    the story is designed as branched instead of linear, so users can have 
                    completely different storylines made by themselves. Besides, more additional 
                    information could be used to help users make the right choices, because they 
                    might still feel unreliable even with some tips after each scene.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    For this course, it provides me a good practical opportunity of designing and 
                    team working. As I have been worked as a developer, I didn't think about the 
                    design and its rationality. During the work in this studio, I took part in the 
                    project as a designer as well, and have more aspects to be concern rather than 
                    just coding. It also helps me a lot as have theoretical knowledge from previous 
                    courses utilized in this project such as heuristic principles and Fitts' law. 
                    Besides, it would be better if the course project could be more like a real 
                    project in industry. Because these projects usually have specific backgrounds 
                    and limitations, so this might focus more on the depth rathe than the breadth 
                    of design. Moreover, although all team members are encouraged to take part in 
                    the design and coding work, but some times the division of work varies, and as 
                    students from master of IT and master of Interaction Design can form a team 
                    together, so if an interaction design student did more coding work than IT 
                    students, this could lead to a mismatch of their major and lack improvement of 
                    their corresponding skills.
